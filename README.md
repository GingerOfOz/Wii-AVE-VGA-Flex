This is intended to be a good starting point for anyone who wants to design a flex that carries VGA video directly from the Wii to a driver board in their portable.  This specific layout is intended for use in the Wiiboy Color II, and has been confimed to fit around the Wii's AVE properly.

This was my first board designed in KiCAD, so if some part of the design seems bizarre or extremely inefficient, it's probably just becuase I didn't know what I was doing.
